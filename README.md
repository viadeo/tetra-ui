========

A smart, easy-to-use toolkit for creating rich interfaces in lightning speed!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Working locally with Tetra UI

Here are the instructions to launch and build locally the whole Tetra UI project.

#### Installing Node.js

If it is not already done, install it here:
<http://nodejs.org/>

#### Getting the `tetra-ui` project

You can use the default GitHub client, or your preferred Git client, or the `git` command line.
For testing purpose another solution is to get the repository as a Zip file.

The repository content must be in a `tetra-ui` folder on your computer.

#### Installing required Node packages

With the command line go to the `tetra-ui` folder:

    cd tetra-ui

Since it is better to install packages locally and not system wide:

    npm install

Now you should have a `node_modules` folder inside `tetra-ui` with all the required Node modules.
The `npm`command installs the dependencies located in `package.json`.

#### Upadting submodules

Tetra UI require 2 different submodule (JSON-js and Tetra) so you have to get them too.
Run these commands in the `tetra-ui` folder:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

#### Launching Tetra UI with Grunt’s built-in server

    grunt watch-server

And then go to this URL in a browser: <http://localhost:8080/> or <http://127.0.0.1:8080/>.

With this `watch-server` task, every time a Less file is changed, Grunt rebuilds the CSS files.
